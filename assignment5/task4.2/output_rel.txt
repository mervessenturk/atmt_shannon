main objective of European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase the average length of healthy life in the EU by 2020.
partnerships are trying to improve the quality of the lives of the elderly citizens and to address health care solutions.
focuses on the use of innovations in a larger scale than that now, in areas such as promotion of health, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems, as well as assistant technologies.
The Commission will conduct the analysis of the consultation to get a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovations in different fields that have an impact on ageing at present.
, on the basis of these replies, further progress in the European Innovation Partnership.
online consultation is also taking place with the Conference on European Partnership for Innovation in the field of active and healthy ageing, which is now held in Brussels.
more than 150 representatives of the stakeholders are discussing their opinions on how to transform partnerships into specific acts.
focus of the European Partnership for Innovation Innovation Initiative is a part of the EU strategy for innovation, which is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy to transform ideas into jobs, ecological growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
the Union of innovations has a goal of: to enable Europe to achieve scientific results at world level, a significant change in the way of cooperation between the public and private sectors, especially with the partnership for innovation and to remove barriers (such as costly patents, fragmentation of market fragmentation, slow deployment of standards and inadequate qualifications) that currently prevail rapidly.

as regards Asian, initiatives should be strengthened to regional cooperation in the field of nutrition.
mission of EU intervention The EU approach to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of assistance, Action Programme from the Akckel and the EU rules on the works of developing policies.
countries and Member States should coordinate their activities under the management of the specific main donor, according to their compulsory benefits.
EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments that partner countries can help to tackle food security problems.
er effectiveness of their measures should help more harmonisation of policies, more closely linked instruments and coordination with private investors.
sustainability of policies to promote development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through the range of policy instruments including agriculture, trade, fisheries, combating climate change, environmental protection and research.
cohesion has been strengthened by the reform of the common agricultural policy and the future reforms will be taken into account for the global objectives of food security.
moreover, the future reform of the common fisheries policy will increase the cohesion of European fisheries policies in the sector and the methods of fishing, of the one and the development objectives of the other.
, not least, the achievement of the balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the Doha Development Programme strengthens international business system, which should be favourable to food security.
improvement of the coherence of the international system of management of the EU and Member States should better align the way to ensure food security in international scale and support the accelerated reform of the Committee on Food Safety in the world (CFS) which is the central authority in the field.
formed committee should endeavour the power of supervision in other specific areas affected by food security, such as food aid and nutrition.
further to rationalise the priorities of the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and their mutual cooperation should be improved.
reforms of the UN and the ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are an opportunity to increase quality and effectiveness.

is not necessary that the question is made by the parties themselves; the national Judge may submit it without a request.
request for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation The Court of First Instance shall be empowered to ask the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Community law if it deems necessary to resolve the dispute before it.
moreover, the Court of First Instance which cannot be challenged by the appeals under national law is essentially obliged to submit to the Court of Justice such a question, unless the case-law exists in that field (and the new framework does not arise in relation to the possibility of using this case-law) or the correct way of interpretation of Community rules is fully clear.
of which the Court of First Instance may be challenged by the appeals, so that, in particular where the case is sufficiently clear on the basis of the case-law of the Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance may decide on the correct interpretation of Community law and its use of the facts made by him.
application for a preliminary ruling may, however, show in the appropriate stage of the proceedings as being particularly helpful as regards a new question of interpretation which is a general meaning for the single use of Community law in the Union or, if the present case-law does not appear to be applicable to a completely new factual framework.
of the national court is to explain the required interpretation necessary for the resolution of its judgment.
of the application for a preliminary ruling on the validity of the national courts have the possibility of rejecting claims relating to invalidity which are applied before them, the possibility of declaring a Community act as invalid fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
: Each national court must therefore submit a request for a preliminary ruling on the validity of a Community measure with regard to the grounds for which it considers that the Community act could be invalid.
: However, if the national Judge has serious doubts as to the validity of the Community act, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of the latter act or adopt any other provisional measure in that regard.
is therefore obliged to ask questions relating to the validity of the Court and to state reasons why the Community act is not applicable.
, at the time of the application for a preliminary ruling The national court may submit a request for a preliminary ruling, as soon as it finds that the decision on questions or issues of interpretation or validity is necessary to give judgment to the Court of First Instance; it is a national court which can best be judged by the Court of First Instance.
however, it is desirable that the decision on the question is adopted in the stages of proceedings, whereby the progressive judge is able to define the facts and the legal framework of the problem so that the Court should be able to establish all the information necessary to verify that Community law is applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings.
may also appear in the interests of the proper administration of justice in order for the question to be put forward after the contradictory discussions of the matter.
in the form of an application for a preliminary ruling by the national Judge the question referred for a preliminary ruling may be adopted in any form which the national law permits in the event of procedural issues.
, however, it must be considered that this is the basis for the proceedings which will take place before the Court of Justice and that the Court of Justice must be able to give it a useful answer to the national court.

ening of the objectives of the common fisheries policy (SRP) should not be compromised by Member States which infringe its rules.
in accordance with Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) , financial assistance from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (ENRF) is subject to compliance with the rules of the CFP by Member States.
holding of the rules of the CFP by Member States may result in discontinuation or suspension of payments or implementation of financial corrections of the Union financial assistance provided under the CFP.
in Article 83(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) lays down the conditions for which the suspension of payment may be imposed and Article 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 ( 3 ) .
of those two articles provides that, in connection with the non-compliance of rules within the framework of the SRP, specific rules may lay down specific grounds for interruptions and suspension of payments.
For the purpose of protecting financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers, where a Member State does not meet its obligations under the CFP or where the Commission has indicated evidence indicating such a non-compliance, the Commission shall be able to discontinue the payment period under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.
In addition to the discontinuation of payments and to avoid the risk of payment of non-compliance with the rules of the CFP in accordance with Article 101 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the payment.
consequences of the sanctions imposed on Member States should be proportionate to the nature, severity, duration and repeat of non-compliance with the rules of the CFP.
in order to ensure legal certainty for Member States carrying out operational programmes within the framework of the ESF, the cases of non-compliance with the rules of the CFF shall be necessary to maintain marine biological resources which may lead to the suspension of payment periods or suspension of payments.
less of all the other sanctions imposed by the CFP rules shall be applied to the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 and the implementation of Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
s of non-compliance with the rules of the CFP, which are essential to maintain biological marine resources, should be considered as severe if the Member State has not taken the necessary measures to remedy the situation which resulted in the discontinuation of payment deadlines.
prior to discontinuation or suspension of payments The Commission must adopt implementing acts pursuant to Article 100(2) and Article 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 which further specifies the non-compliance obligations under the CFP by the Member State which may influence the costs for which it is required.
Since it is important to ensure uniform and equal treatment of operators in all Member States from the beginning of the programme period, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following the publication of the Official Journal of the European Union, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

if the ten-year limitation period should start running until the administration of APSA vaccine to the Ministry of Health, the precise moment of sale of APMSD to the Ministry of Health should be determined to date the beginning of the limitation period.
, irrespective of whether, under this assumption, the limitation period for APSA would be interrupted in time by submitting an application against APMSD ( 36 ) would be initiated on 16 October 2002 against APPSA in any event before the end of the ten-year period, if the vaccine of the sale of the ministry of the health industry would be placed in circulation on 16 October 1992.
in the event that the precise moment of sale of the ministry of the Ministry of Health, and it would only be possible to define it for the period between 22 September 1992 — the date of the adoption of the vaccine in the APMSD — and on 3 November 1992 — vaccination of the defendant — would be possible to initiate proceedings against APPSA on 16 October 2002 in each event of a limitation period of time limits.
if the APSA complained about limitation, it would also have to demonstrate the moment of putting the vaccine into circulation.
if APSA as a manufacturer can only define this moment as a certain period beginning over ten years before submitting proceedings, but ending less than ten years before submitting it, the APSA would not only be silent as a manufacturer of proof, but also proof of determination of the precise moment of initiation of the limitation period.
in the event that the precise moment of entry into circulation would be to be put in place on 16 October 2002, in any event in time, and therefore the effect of the interruption of the limitation period.

of these partner countries also have their own national action programmes in this respect.
in the event of Ukraine there is a Special Action Plan for Justice, Freedom and Security, corresponding to part of this area in Action Plans negotiated with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova, and the Commission also cooperates with Ukraine on the basis of evaluation results derived from the Action Plan on Justice, Freedom and Security, which is directed.
issues are already discussed with Moldova and Ukraine in the relevant subcommittees, as well as discussed at the regular meetings of the ministerial EU-Ukraine for justice, security and justice, as well as meeting of the Committee on cooperation and cooperation.
similar approach follows in the case of three countries of the Southern Caucasus, which were adopted in November 2006.

fight against doping Doping remains a serious threat.
use of doping substances in the event of non-professional athletes is a serious threat to public health, and requires preventive measures, including the establishment of centres for the protection of good physical condition.
prevention and sanctions in the field of doping are covered by the powers of sports organisations and Member States.
The Commission supports the fight against doping and the important role of the World Antidoping Agency, the National Antidoping Organisations, accredited laboratories, the Council of Europe and UNESCOs.
also welcomes the fact that national anti-dumping organisations are increasingly organised as independent authorities.
ates Member States to adopt and share national anti-dumping actions aimed at ensuring coordination between all the relevant sectors.
number of stakeholders requires a more active approach by the EU in the fight against doping, for example by adopting Antidoping Conventions of the Council of Europe, if the competence in the Union allows.
should be evaluated by the consequences of the Union's powers under Article 165 TFEU as regards the representation of the EU within the framework of the management structures of the World Antidoping Agency.
The Commission underlines the need for anti-doping rules and procedures that would be compatible with EU law with regard to respect for fundamental rights and principles such as respect for private and family life, the protection of personal data and the right to fair hearing and presumption of innocence.
of the exercise of such rights and freedoms must be provided by law and respect the substance of those rights and principles of proportionality.

patients should be carefully monitored for any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiological exercise or operation.
concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended as it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
if the patient is to undergo the planned operation and the antiaggregation effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days before performance.
patients should warn, before planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy, physicians and dentalists, that they use clopidogrel.
. Klopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should therefore be administered to patients with tendencies for bleeding (especially gastrointestinal and intraocular).
patients should be informed that, if they use clopidogrel (self or in combination with ASA), the body of bleeding could take longer than usual, and that they should be aware of any unusual bleeding (locke or length) of their doctor.

for this purpose the Commission intends to submit to the Committee for the noise referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme, which contains certain of the following elements.
if necessary, the Commission will also consider whether to administer the actions described below.
Completion of the harmonised framework for mapping In spite of the improvement of the comparability of strategic noise mapping is not an ideal situation.
of the ongoing evaluation is clear that it is still hard to submit comparable information on the number of persons exposed to excessive noise levels.
difficulties relate, inter alia, to the different methods of data collection, quality and availability of data and the methods of evaluation.
is the cause of different results in the EU Member States.
the required level of comparability will ultimately lead to the harmonisation framework(s) to be sufficiently reflected by the sectoral specifications.
in 2008, the Commission began to work on the development of the harmonised methods of evaluation of noise exposure (according to Article 6(2)).
project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common evaluation methods of noise in Europe) which lead to the Joint Research Centre shall ensure the technical basis for the preparation of the Commission Implementing Decision.
, assuming that it will be possible to complete the technical work in 2011, the Commission is considering the possible revision of Annex II to the Directive on noise in the rural intermediate in the beginning of 2012 (the Committee in 2011 will deliver an opinion).
harmonised methodological framework could be concentrated on strategic mapping and carefully balanced with regard to the harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specifications, such as data requirements.
In the framework of this Decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint work programme of the Commission/European Environment Agency aimed at implementing the CNOSSSSSOS-EU project in 2012-2015 to be a functional for the third cycle of reporting in 2017.
development of the implementation of EU guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaving space for different interpretation and implementation.
of the Member States suggested that these issues be addressed through a specific event that will help to implement and comply with the EU level, such as the development of documents with instructions, exchange of information on best practices or by holding special workshops and training courses.
such a measure could focus on these issues: mapping methods and best practice mapping, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and response, the calculation of repeated exposures, the formation of action plans and permissible or targeted.

creation of a legal and fiscal environment, which is favourable to undertakings In order to benefit from all the opportunities offered by the Single Market, including the freedom of establishment, the rules on which the Single Market is based, simple, adapted and need to meet the challenges faced by businesses in the daily business meet.
measures proposed in this Section are calculated by reducing administrative and regulatory burden, with positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
in this framework will be adopted very specific initiatives to ensure the interconnections of the registers of business companies and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
are also essential.
initiatives in corporate taxation or VAT should limit administrative burdens and facilitate their cross-border activities.
moreover, the particular attention of the defence and security sectors deserving to stimulate development and growth throughout the economy as a result of their top technology, innovations and know-how.
Proposal No 19 : The Commission will adopt initiatives to improve coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular the Proposal for a Directive to establish a joint consolidated basis of corporate tax (CZS) in 2011.
s of the existing national system of taxation of companies in the EU have great distinctions, creating important fiscal barriers to cross-border activities of companies or even preventing such activities.
of such fragmentation leads to considerable market disturbance and the cost of placing in accordance with the rules.
in particular SMEs, which often meet the necessary resources to overcome these deficiencies, and can deter from developing in the Single Market.
roduction of the joint consolidated corporate tax base is to address the problem of fiscal provisions that limit growth.
groups of companies should be governed by only a single set of rules in fiscal matters, and should be dealing with only one fiscal governance throughout the EU (‘uniform contact point’).
loss should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted, irrespective of the limits.
ases of double taxation or double exemption as a result of the difference or incompatibility of national fiscal rules would be excluded in relation to intra-groups.
non-coordinated measures at national level would only reproduce the current situation, as companies are still confronted with so many fiscal systems, as the states in which those companies operate.
in this respect must be borne in mind that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 lays down that, if the dispute resolution authority is to adopt a report on uncontested measures, the Council may, if it deems appropriate, cancel or amend the contested measure or adopt other adequate specific measures to take account of the legal interpretation in the formulated.
in accordance with recital 5 of the Regulation, the European Union institutions may deem appropriate to withdraw or amend the measures adopted pursuant to the basic Regulation, including those who are not subject to dispute resolution proceedings within the framework of the framework of the agreement on the rules and procedures for managing disputes, or adopt other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation of the contained in the report adopted by the resolution authority.
moreover, as the applicants correctly state, the provisions of European Union law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the objective of those provisions is to implement the international agreement concluded by the Community, such as that of the basic Regulation which has been adopted to meet international obligations arising under the anti-dumping agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

. 42 The Court of First Instance did not state that Article 2 of the decision on the Comitology which sets out the non-binding criteria for the selection of procedural conditions to be respected is not covered by the appellant in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measure with general scope.
s The Commission's arguments 43 The Commission considers that the reference to recital 9 of Regulation No 3319/94 does not be relevant for the purpose of the interpretation of Article 1(3), second subparagraph of Article 1(3) of this Regulation imposing a specific duty where two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of the products of the ZAP.
As regards Article 2 of the decision on comitology, the Commission challenges the CMF’s assertions that the Court of First Instance said that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measures with general scope.
Conclusions of the Court 45 The two parts of the appeals examined and, therefore, the very reason of the ground of appeal.
As the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, both of the part of the appeals examined are more specifically raised within the fourth part of the fourth ground of appeal, respecting the third ground of appeal which is challenged by their own legal analysis carried out by the Court.
.
, it is therefore not necessary to examine them independently.
For the ground of appeal based on distortion of the facts of Argumentation of the parties – Arguments of the appellant 50 CMF submits that the Court of First Instance in paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, in which the facts are reunited, the facts of the case have been adopted have completely fictional legal structure of the relevant national authorities on the existence of indirect invoices.
This performance is incomplete and incorrect, and therefore lead to distortions of facts.

in that regard is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
, however, it must be held that the Court of First Instance indicated, on the one hand, that the overall impression triggering the trade mark applied for, dominates the element ‘creationes kennya’ to which the consumer refers broadly to a broad extent to its attention, and, secondly, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘ck’ element ‘crecoveries kennya’ refers to the sole secondary position, which essentially implies that element ‘ck’ is negligible.
of the Court of First Instance, which has ruled out, on the correct analysis, any similarity between the conflicting marks, and in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal was right to conclude that, despite the good reputation of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
59 The third part of the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared unfounded.
, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
for the second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that he infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 did not examine the good name of the earlier marks in the framework of that provision.
(6)2 The Court of First Instance has doubted that, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the appellant has put forward a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, while the application was expressly based also on infringement of Article 8(5) of this Regulation.
: 63 The Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that, as conflicting marks are not similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of the earlier marks.
of the fact that the earlier trade mark of Calvin Klein is generally well-known should be applied to the appellant for the purpose of determining whether it is necessary to confer extensive protection.
name of the earlier trade mark must be assessed in the evaluation of similarity between the marks and not after the similarity has been shown.
, in that regard, the appellant submits that, if the pro-limate figurative marks are protected only where the third person(s) of the ‘cK’ would be used in the same way as the graphic representation, it would imply that the trade mark of the CK, with a good name, would be conferred on the level of protection that is practically lower than the level of protection that it would be known to be.
of the fact that the trade marks of the cK and other other distinctive graphic representation of those letters are well founded is conferred on them to protection against the use of the ‘CK’ in the fashion industry, since the third party identifies Calvin Klein in the sector, so that their use is made by third parties is confident.
of OHIM contends that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has law on the matter of good names of the earlier mark.
since the sign at issue cannot be considered as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 shall not apply.
: 66 Zafra Marroquineros states that the reference to the good name of the earlier marks is made in the judgment under appeal.

provisions should be fixed.
checks on conditionality may be completed before receipt of payments and annual premiums pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
in cases where such inspections cannot be completed before the receipt of such payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the recipient as a result of administrative sanctions should be applied in accordance with this Regulation or the beginning.
rules should be applied to the authorities in the Member States responsible for the system of control of cross-compliance obligations.
should be fixed by the minimum level of control for the verification of compliance obligations.
rates of inspections should be determined at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, which fall within the scope of the competent authorities and which must be selected based on adequate risk analysis.
For the purpose of calculating the control specimen, in the special case of the groups of persons in accordance with Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, Member States should be made available to Member States when determining whether the group is to be considered as a whole or any member of the group individually.
Member States should be able to choose whether the minimum level of inspections at the level of each competent supervisory authority, at the level of the paying agency or at the level of the act or standard, or a set of acts or standards.
if the specific legislation applicable to acts or standards sets minimum controls, Member States should comply with those rates.
Member States should be allowed to apply a single level of on-site inspections.
, if Member States choose this possibility, all non-compliance cases found during the on-site inspections by sectoral legislation should be reported and subsequently monitored in connection with conditions.
in order to simplify, as regards the duty applicable to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of the selection of specimens from the monitoring plan should be considered to meet the minimum rate set out in this Regulation.
Member States should be made available to the flexibility necessary to achieve the minimum level of the monitoring of results from other on-site inspections or by replacing beneficiaries.
to avoid weakening of the control system, especially with regard to the selection of samples for on-site inspections, should not be taken into account in the calculation of the minimum control specimen relating to the conditionality of the subsequent checks carried out in relation to de minimis rule pursuant to Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
findings of significant non-compliance in relation to conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-site inspections in order to meet the acceptable level of assurance as regards the correctness of the applications concerned.
